# Stress Level and Heart Beat Analysis in Humans

## ðŸ“Š Overview
This Power BI project analyzes the relationship between **stress levels** and **heart beat rates** in humans.  
Using **sample data**, the report visualizes how variations in heart rate can reflect changes in stress, helping users understand basic physiological patterns.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Analyze and visualize the correlation between **heart rate** and **stress level**.
- Identify patterns and trends in physiological responses.
- Demonstrate Power BIâ€™s capability for data-driven health insights.

---

## ðŸ§© Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** (.pbix)
- **Sample Dataset (CSV/Excel)**
- **Data Visualization Techniques** (Charts, Cards, Tables)
- **DAX Calculations** (if applicable)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Average, maximum, and minimum heart rate values.
- Stress level distribution among different individuals.
- Relationship between increased heart rate and stress intensity.
- Visual dashboards to make data interpretation simple.

## ðŸ§  How to Use
1. Download the `.pbix` file.
2. Open it using **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**.
3. Explore the report pages to view:
   - Overview dashboard
   - Heart rate vs. stress analysis
   - Summary visuals

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset
This project uses **sample human stress and heart rate data**.  
Each record typically includes:
- `Person_ID`
- `Heart_Beat` (bpm)
- `Stress_Level` (Low / Medium / High)
- `Time` or `Activity` context (optional)

---

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
- Integrate **real sensor data** (IoT or smartwatch readings).
- Add **predictive analytics** using machine learning.
- Include **real-time data visualization** dashboards.
